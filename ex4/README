each node in the list point to the next node in the list
and point to the previous node in the list

(the first node in the list point to the last node in the list
and the last node in the list point to the first node in the list)

the program, using generic functions, scan the list and print:
the first value from the beginning that bigger than 0
the first value from the end that bigger than 0
the first value from the beginning that is prime
the first value from the end that is prime
the first value from the beggining that is palindrom
the first value from the end that is palindrom

Compilte: g++ -Wall ex4a.cc -o ex4a
Run: ./ex4a
Input:
numbers until eof
Output:
output as described
