Dynamic array allocation
=============================================
Written by: Netanel Stern, id = 206342255, login = netanelst

This program read from the user num of rows in the matrix
and the data for each row than print the sum
the matrix size is dynamic and depend on the input from the user

Compile: g++ -Wall ex1a.cc -o ex1a
Run: ex1a
Input:
num of rows in the matrix and content of each row

Output:
sum of the matrix

Sentences and strings
=============================================
Written by: Netanel Stern, id = 206342255, login = netanelst

This program read sentences from the user and store in a mtrix
inside a struct
then, the program break each sentence into strings
each string is only one word (split the sentence by the space)

Compile: g++ -Wall ex1b.cc -o ex1b
Run: ex1b
Input:
num of rows in the matrix and content of each row

Output:
sum of the matrix

Numbers matrix
=============================================
Written by: Netanel Stern, id = 206342255, login = netanelst

this program read rows of numbers from the user and save them in the struct
in int matrix

for each row, the program check:
if the row is already exist or there is an exist row that contains the new
row, the row will be ignored
if the new row contains an existing row (the beginning of the rows are
equal), the new row will replace the existing one
otherwise, the new row will be added to the matrix

the program can print the matrix

Compile: g++ -Wall ex1c.cc -o ex1c
Run: ex1c
Input:
0: exit
1: add new row - first input for row length, after insert the content of
the row
2: print the matrix

Output:
the matrix
