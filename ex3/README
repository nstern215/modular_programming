Node and sub node
=============================================
Written by: Netanel Stern, id = 206342255, login = netanelst
This program read numbers from the client untill eof and build
a search binary tree.
Then, the program count how many nodes exists that the node
and his left sun values are equal, then print the result

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3a.cc -o ex3a
Run: ex3a
Input:
numbers until eof
Output:
how many nodes exists that the node
and his left sun values are equal

Tree of points
=============================================
Written by: Netanel Stern, id = 206342255, login = netanelst
This program read numbers from the client untill eof and build
a search binary tree.
for each node the program read three numbers
one for the id of the node and two for the point (x,y)

the program look for the biggest sun tree that all of his nodes
are in the same part of a kartezic axises system
 
Compile: g++ -Wall ex3b.cc -o ex3b
Run: ex3b
Input:
numbers until eof
Output:
the point value of the root of the sub tree

File: ex3c.cc
biggest tree with even numbers
=============================================
Written by: Netanel Stern, id = 206342255, login = netanelst
This program read numbers from the client untill eof and build
a search binary tree.

the program will look for the biggest sub tree that the
amount of even numbers are much bigeer than the amount of 
odd numbers
 
Compile: g++ -Wall ex3c.cc -o ex3c
Run: ex3c
Input:
numbers until eof
Output:
the value of the root of the sub tree
